===========================

How to use
**********

It is just as easy as that::
    
	import normalization

	#creates a database and reads attributes and FDs
	sample_db = normalization.database()

	#prints attributes, FDs and candidate keys
	sample_db.print_all()
	
	#test for violations of 2NF, 3NF and BCNF
	sample_db.test_all_NFs()
	
	#dependency preserving loseless join decomposition into 3NF
	sample_db.dep_los_3NFdecompose()
